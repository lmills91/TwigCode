Twig Coding Challenge

This code can be obtained either by downloading zip or by typing git clone https://github.com/lmills91/TwigCode.git in to console.

This is a simple function written which will turn a 1d array in to a 2d array. 
It takes 2 inputs from the user - length of array and the number of arrays to be within the array (both positive, whole numbers).  The 1d and subsequent 2d array are then autogenerated by the function.

The code was written as standalone so no virtual machines or servers are required.  
It can simply be opened and ran in a python IDE - I used Pycharm, where shift+F10 will run the code in the Pycharm console.
